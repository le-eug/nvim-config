# Eug's Neovim Config

## Introduction
Welcome to my Neovim config. I made this by stealing other people's code.
Perhaps one day I will make it all on my own, but I do not want to do that right
now. I like using vim because I am quicker. It actually makes the act of
programming fun. I enjoy programming thanks to vim and this config makes the
experience all the better.

This README will probably only contain keymaps for now just for my own
reference.

## Keymaps
- leader-fe = Go to netrw
- leader-sf = Fuzzy find to search files
- leader-sg = Fuzzy find for live grep
- leader-to = Fuzzy find TODOs (and NOTEs, WARNs, etc.)
- grd = Goto Definition
- grD = Goto Declaration
- gO  = Open Document Symbols (Document symbols are variables, functions, etc.)
- gW  = Open Workspace Symbols (Like gO, but for the whole project)
- grT = Goto Type Definition
- gD  = Show Diagnostics (LSP diagnostics like errors and warnings)

Note: "leader" is "Space".
